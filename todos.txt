# Namerit

Jaky podil ma precision LB na celkovovy TED, tzn.

zmerim si cas filtru na jednotlivych stromech -> jakmile mam kandidaty pustit vypocet TED -> zmerim cas vypoctu -> ulozit cas LB filteru, TEDu a celkovy cas!




Udělat různé kolekce se strukturalnimi rozdily

Doladit strukturalni filtr


Při prvních průchodu součet L1 vzdálenosti mapovacích regionů
Při druhém průchodu součet maximálních hodnot L1 vzdálenosti a nenamapovaných uzlů v každém stromu mapovacích regionů

tj. při prvním průchodu po regionu {vpravo, potomci, vlevo a předchůdci}
0 6 0 0 -> (0 4 0 0, 0 2 0 0)


Jak zrychlit pruchod nenamapovaných:

Pri pruchodu je potreba mit mnoziny:
    preceding -> nemusim mit mnozinu, staci jen pocet preceding
    ancestor -> kontroluju pozpatku, jako stack, dokud nenarazim na prvni opravdovy ancestor. Presouvaji se jen do preceding.
    following -> kontroluju dokud nenarazim na opravdovy following
    descendants -> Musim zkontrolovat vsechny
    



Zkusit udělat SF-Adjusted už při prvním průchodu -> nenamapované uzly zjišťovat jen podle labelu (nalezen, nenalezen), takže
ignorujeme možné špatné mapování kvůli L1 distance. 




Druhy zpusob:

Pri pocitani LB, najit X nejvice spolecnych labelu v obou stromech a pak rozdelit jakoby na 2 osy kazdy strom.
Prvni budou mapovaci regiony BEZ nalezenych nejvice spolecny, druha osa mapovaci regiony a POUZE nalezene nejvice spolecne labely.

Vysledek je pak L1(OSA 1) + L1(OSA 2)
